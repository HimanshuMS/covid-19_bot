This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.\n\nWHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.\n\n**Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?**\nStudies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.\n\n**Can COVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?**\nThe main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.\n\nWHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings."

            description = "\n\n**Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?**\nThe risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating.\n\n**Can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source?**\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals. Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed.\nTo protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products.\n\n**Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet?**\nThere is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit COVID-19.

This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).\nIf you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.

Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.\n\n**Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.**\nWhy?  When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.\n\n**Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth**\nWhy? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth.

They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection.\n\n**Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?**\nWhile some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease.

            description = "\n\nChildren may respond to stress in different ways such as being more clingy, anxious, withdrawing, angry or agitated, bedwetting etc. Respond to your child’s reactions in a supportive way, listen to their concerns and give them extra love and attention.\n\nChildren need adults’ love and attention during difficult times. Give them extra time and attention. Remember to listen to your children, speak kindly and reassure them. If possible, make opportunities for the child to play and relax.\n\nTry and keep children close to their parents and family and avoid separating children and their caregivers to the extent possible. If separation occurs (e.g. hospitalization) ensure regular contact (e.g. via phone) and re-assurance\n\nKeep to regular routines and schedules as much as possible, or help create new ones in a new environment, including school/learning as well as time for safely playing and relaxing.\n\nProvide facts about what has happened, explain what is going on now and give them clear information about how to reduce their risk of being infected by the disease in words that they can understand depending on their age. This also includes providing information about what could happen in a re-assuring way (e.g. a family member and/or the child may start not feeling well and may have to go to the hospital for some time so doctors can help them feel better)."
